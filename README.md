# Mobile game "Egger" for android and ios

What was implemented:
1. Initial page with Start button. It is placed in a separate folder because it is possible to add buttons here: Settings, Game for two, and other functionality in the future.
2. The next page contains a game where you have to drag the egg into the correct basket. If successful, you will see a welcome window

Technology stack:

1. DART
2. FLUTTER
